# dx11_project
Personal project where I tinker with DX11

My main purpose with this project is to play around with DX11, DirectX Tool Kit and the object-oriented organization of a project.

- Current focus is to create a game with minimal graphical techniques to get experience in organizing possible abstractions (e.g model, where to draw, etc.)


Controls:
A - Toggle between Absolute and Relative mouse mode (visible/invisible)
