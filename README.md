# dx11_project
Personal project where I tinker with D3D11  
  
My main purpose with this project is to play around with DX11, DirectX Tool Kit and get more experience just implementing things with D3D11
  
- Goal of this project is to just make things work. Implement some techniques and maybe play around with some OOP principles

Controls:  
  
WASD : Move  
T : Toggle between Absolute and Relative mouse mode (visible/invisible)  
Q : Descend  
Space : Ascend  
O : Remove the static cube objects in order (WARNING: Intentionally asserting false once you try to remove when there are none of the static cubes left)  
P : Inserts a triangle infront of the camera  
G : Toggle render state for the floating and rotating cube object (Object and mesh still lives but user can choose whether to render it or not)  
  
Project should build (DirectXTK Desktop Win10 NuGet package is installed so make sure it is restored)  
Make sure that SubSystem is set to Windows and the dependencies "d3d11.lib", "dxgi.lib", "d3dcompiler.lib" are added  
  
Preview as of September 6th 2020.  
- Dynamically insert and remove objects (with meshes)  
- Dynamically insert and remove point lights (Space for 500 (can be user-specified) lights is reserved for the Structured Buffer during initialization)  
  - No code for handling exceeding amount of maximum point lights right now.  
- Toggle Render State for existing Objects (Graphics will skip drawing that objects mesh)
- Toggle Update State for existing Point Lights (Ensures an identifier is set for the light (Constant attenuation set to -1) so that HLSL can skip the calculation for that specific light)
- Gamma correction (inverse square law for attenuation now works well!)
- Basic GPU simulated particle system (Zink implementation)
- Skybox

Example of "interface" to create an object, a point light, and how to modify them during Update!
