# dx11_project
Personal project where I tinker with DX11

My main purpose with this project is to play around with DX11, DirectX Tool Kit and the organization of a larger project

- Current focus is to create a game with minimal graphical techniques to get experience in organizing possible abstractions (e.g model, where to draw, etc.)

Controls:
T - Toggle between Absolute and Relative mouse mode (visible/invisible)

WASD : Move

Q : Descend
E : Ascend

Project should build (DirectXTK Desktop Win10 NuGet package is installed so make sure it is restored)
Make sure that SubSystem is set to Windows and the dependencies "d3d11.lib", "dxgi.lib", "d3dcompiler.lib" are added
